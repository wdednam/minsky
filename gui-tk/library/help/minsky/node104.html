Groups
</H1>

<P>
Grouping gives the capability to create reusable modules, or subroutines that
can dramatically simplify more complicated systems. Groups may be
created in the following ways:

<UL>
<LI>by lassoing a number of items to select them, then selecting
&ldquo;group&rdquo; from the canvas context menu, or the edit menu.
</LI>
<LI>by pasting the selection. You may &ldquo;ungroup&rdquo; the group from the
context menu if you don't desire the result of the paste to be a group.
</LI>
<LI>by copying another group
</LI>
<LI>by inserting a Minsky file as a group
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Zooming in on a group allows you see and edit its contents. Groups may
be nested heirarchically, which gives an excellent way of zooming in
to see the detail of a model, or zooming out to get an overview of
it. The group context menu item &ldquo;Zoom to display&rdquo; zooms the canvas
in just enough for the group's contents to be visible.

<P>
You may also select &ldquo;Open in canvas&rdquo; from the context menu. This
replaces the current canvas contents with the contents of the group,
allowing you to edit the contents of the group directly without the
distractions of the rest of the model. Select &ldquo;Open master group&rdquo; to
return to the top level group occupying the canvas.

<P>
Around the edges of a group are input or output variables, which allow
one to parameterise the group. One can drag a variable and dock it in
the I/O area to create a new input or output for the group.

<P>
When creating a group, or dragging a variable or operation into or out
of a group, if a wire ends up crossing the group boundary, a new
temporary variable is added as an I/O variable.

<P>
Variable names within groups are locally scoped to that group. That
means that a variable of the same name outside the group refers to a
different entity completely. One can refer to variables outside the
current scope by prepending the variable name with a `:'. This refers
to a local variable within an outer scope, going all the way to global
scope if no such variable exists. In this way, two groups can share
a variable reference to a variable by using the `:' prefix, and you
can limit the scope of the shared variable by placing a local variable
of the same name in an outer group that both groups are contain within.

<P>
A group can also be exported to a file from the context menu.
This allows you to build up a library of building blocks. There is a
github project &ldquo;minsky-models&rdquo; allowing people to publish their
building blocks and models for others to use. In the future, we hope
to integrate Minsky with this github repository, allowing even more
seamless sharing of models.
